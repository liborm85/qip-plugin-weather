FileTools is a collection of several objects to copy and pack files using
a separate thread. It can be used as a Delphi interface to the zlib-library
from Jean-Loup Gailly and Mark Adler.

Implementation to your program is easy: You just need to include the unit in the
uses statement of your program.
A delphi sample program to show how to use is included.

Features:
---------
  - Copying files in an own thread
  - Packing and unpacking of gz-format (gz-files contain original filename and
    timestamp) in an own thread
  - Creating of Zip-compatible archives, Zip64-Format is supported.
